MediaPeek provides detailed technical metadata for video, audio, image, and subtitle files directly in the browser. It fetches only the data segments needed for analysis, without downloading the full file first.

## Features

| Capability | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| **Range-based analysis** | Reads only the parts of a remote file that MediaInfo needs instead of downloading the full asset first. |
| **Archive-aware inspection** | Opens supported media inside `.zip` and `.tar` archives and keeps both archive and inner filenames visible. |
| **Flexible sources** | Works with direct HTTP/HTTPS media URLs and supported public sources such as Google Drive files and folders. |
| **Multiple output formats** | Exports metadata as Object, JSON, Text, HTML, or XML for inspection, sharing, or reuse. |
| **Secure result sharing** | Shares reports through end-to-end encrypted PrivateBin links. |
| **Safer fetch pipeline** | Blocks local and private network targets to reduce SSRF risk. |

## Known Issues

- [x] **Archive bitrate accuracy**. Fixed in [d782473](https://github.com/DG02002/mediapeek/commit/d7824738b9f94b963b0370f7faa4733d771ce767). MediaPeek now corrects file size and bitrate for archive-backed media when the inner entry size can be verified from archive metadata. If the inner size cannot be verified reliably, the UI marks the result as archive-estimated and shows an info tooltip.

- [x] **MediaInfo seek reads over lazy HTTP range fetches**. Fixed in [5fa672a](https://github.com/DG02002/mediapeek/commit/5fa672aaab37b5a847183416b5e5083347387209) with a patch shared by `@cjee21` during discussion of a similar MediaInfo macOS build bug in [MediaInfoLib #2555](https://github.com/MediaArea/MediaInfoLib/issues/2555).
